title: Solitary came looking for me
---

Like a lotus leaf surrounded by muddy water yet sticks no mud
The boy was amidst overwhelming activity – its chaos never cared to touch him.
A sense of vastness engulfed his empty mind – a blank stare is what the world could see.

Mates came looking to play, 
they found benefit in a boy that did not compete,
he did what was said without revolt - there was no fear
–the boy was empty.
